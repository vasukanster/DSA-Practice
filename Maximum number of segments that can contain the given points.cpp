/* Maximum number of segments that can contain the given points
Given an array arr[] containing N integers and two integers X and Y. Consider N line segments, where each line segment has starting and ending point as arr[i] â€“ X and arr[i] + Y respectively. 
Given another array b[] of M points. The task is to assign these points to segments such that the number of segments that have been assigned a point is maximum. 
Note that a point can be assigned to at most 1 segment.
Examples: 

Input: arr[] = {1, 5}, b = {1, 1, 2}, X = 1, Y = 4 
Output: 1 
Line Segments are [1-X, 1+Y] , [5-X, 5+Y] i.e. [0, 5] and [4, 9] 
The point 1 can be assigned to the first segment [0, 5] 
No points can be assigned to the second segment. 
So 2 can also be assigned to the first segment but it will not maximize the no. of segment. 
So the answer is 1.
Input: arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4}, b = {1, 3, 5}, X = 0, Y = 0 
Output: 2
